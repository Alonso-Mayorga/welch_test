# Welch Test Function in R

This repository contains a simple R function for performing the Welch's t-test and an example of how to use it.

## Files

1. `welch.R`: This file contains the R function `welch()` that calculates the Welch's t-test for two independent samples.

2. `welch_example.R`: This file provides an example of how to use the `welch()` function. It loads sample data, calls the function with the sample data, and prints the results.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have R installed on your system.

2. Download or clone this repository.

3. Open `welch.R` to view the implementation of the `welch_test()` function. The function definition includes:

   - `data`: The combined data from different treatment groups.
   - `factor`: A vector indicating the treatment group each observation belongs to.
   - `alpha`: The significance level for hypothesis testing.

4. To use the `welch` function, follow these steps in your R environment:

   - Load the `welch.R` file.
   - Load your data and create a vector indicating the treatment groups.
   - Call the `welch` function with your data, treatment factor, and desired significance level.

     ```r
     source("welch.R")
     # Load your data
     y1 <- c(95, 32, 97, 75, 83, 84, 73, 68)
     y2 <- c(85, 90, 79, 50, 32, 84, 78, 95, 65, 80)
     y3 <- c(79, 92, 64, 68, 76, 20, 37, 74, 86)
     improvement <- c(y1, y2, y3)
     # Create a factor indicating the treatment groups
     treatment <- c(rep("1", 8), rep("2", 10), rep("3", 9))
     # Call the welch function
     welch(improvement, treatment, 0.05)
     ```

5. The function will output whether the null hypothesis is rejected or accepted based on the calculated F-statistic, critical value, and p-value.
